Reflection
What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was exciting to see the html code render into an actual site in real time. It was rewarding to see something concrete come out of our efforts and made me understand better how web pages are made.
How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It was fairly easy to research elements online, and I feel like I had gotten the basics down from the CodeAcademy tutorials.
How did you do at keeping to best practices?
I think my partner and I did well at sticking to best practices guidelines, as we followed the instructions and didn't use style formatting in the HTML.
What seems good and bad about HTML?
The good thing about HTML is that it seems very straightforward and easy to understand and learn. After just a few tutorials I could easily add tags to a page.
The bad thing is that it seems limited in what it can do. It is of course essential for providing the skeleton of the page, but can't do style formatting like CSS. But then again, maybe that is not a bad thing since we have other tools for those things.
What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
I don't have any specific tricks for remembering HTML, other than looking at the tutorials whenever I need a reminder of syntax. I just try to remember to add in a closing tag after the opening tag so as not to forget it later.
