Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
Go to your GitHub profile page and click on the + button to add a new repository, fill out the page with the correct name and description and make sure to click Public and select an MIT license. Then click the green Create Repository button. To clone the repository to your local computer, you first copy the URL address from the  repository page. Then open your terminal, making sure you're in the correct directory and type in the following command: git clone repository-url.  You may have to enter your GitHub username and password, and the folder should be accessible from Sublime. The file is now on your local computer.
Describe what open source means.
Open source means that the source code behind a piece of software is available to the public, as opposed to just the finished output. Anyone can add to, improve and distribute the source code.
What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I think Open Source is a great idea, and can result in good code work by a variety of people. The fact that many Open Source projects are non-profit makes me glad that there are programmers who want to create something for the public good. I do understand however that many companies need to make a profit and therefore don't release their source code.
Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses seem like a good idea, because they provide certain protections to the creators even though the source code is free. The original authors must be attributed in most cases, so they get credit for their work. Some licenses prohibit others from putting out the source code on their own and profiting from it. Some authors charge for their software but allow it to be freely distributed, so some profit is generated but keeps the source code essentially free. Overall licenses seem like common sense, but I'd have to research them more to know the specific benefits and drawbacks.
What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
I initially had some struggles with cloning and pull/pushing files, specifically with deleting a branch at the end. I had to go back to previous instructions to make it work, which took some time but I feel more confident about those concepts now.
Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I was able to complete the assignment using just the resources listed on the page.
