1.1 Think About Time
I chose to read up on some counter-intuitive productivity strategies. This topic resonated with me because I have often felt that conventional time-management techniques didn’t work as well for me. I thought I had to do things a certain rigid way and that is not what they are recommending here. I liked the ideas that focused on the natural cycles versus steady-state, and the idea of starting on a very small scale. I will try a number of these ideas, including giving myself less time to complete tasks and seeing how much I accomplish.
Time boxing is the strategy that involves setting an increment of time and then performing a certain task for only that length of time, then evaluating what was accomplished. I can use this in DBC by starting to gauge how long certain tasks typically take and structuring a schedule accordingly. I currently use either a planner to keep track of my time and schedule, along with to do lists, but its not very effective because I frequently go off-schedule and then feel guilty for not being more productive.
My plan is to research a little more on counter productive strategies and try them out to see which works best. I’m also going to change how I write out a weekly schedule and banish the long to do lists that are not effective.

1.2 The Command Line
1. A shell is basically a user interface between the user and the operating system and gives access to everything on a computer. It can be either a command line interface or a graphical user interface. Bash is a popular type of shell for OSX and Unix.
2.  The most challenging thing in going through the material was just being patient while I sorted through any mistakes. The first real challenge was understanding the pushd and popd commands and what they did. I had to work and practice to understand them, not just go through the motions. I also had trouble with creating the new ex12.txt file and copying it to my temp directory but I figured that out.
3. I was able to use all the commands successfully, once I learned to pay attention and type them in correctly. I still don’t fully understand ever single command but I was able to get them to work.
4. The cd command is one of the most important, because it’s used so often. Pwd and ls are important to locate where you are in the directory and which files are there. Mkdir, rmdir, and rm are important for creating and removing directories and files.
5. Commands
pwd: print working directory, which shows which directory you’re on
ls: this lists and displays all the files in a directory
mv: moving or renaming files by typing the old file name and the new file name
cd: change directory, which moves to the specified directory
../: this command moves between levels of a directory
touch: this command makes a new empty file
mkdir: this makes a new empty directory
less: this lets you page through a file
rmdir: this removes a directory as long as it’s empty
rm: this removes a file
help: displays available commands

1.4 Forking and Cloning
To create a new repository, I would instruct someone to go to their GitHub profile page and click on the + button, fill out the repository page with the correct name and information and click the Create Repository button. To fork a repository, go to the repository page you want, and click the Fork button, then select your profile. To clone the repository to your local computer, you first copy the URL address from the forked repository page. Then open your terminal, open the correct directory and type in the following command: git clone repository-url.  You may have to enter your GitHub username and password, and the folder should be accessible from Sublime.
I had a fairly simple time setting up git and GitHub. I made sure to read the instructions step-by-step and not rush things, since the main challenges I faced were mostly typos entered into the command line. I learned to pay especially close attention to detail, as most of my errors tended to be syntax errors. I also learned to allow myself enough time to set things up, and have patience when learning new concepts, which seems obvious enough but it’s something that’s good to remind myself of.
