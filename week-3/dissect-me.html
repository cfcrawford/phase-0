    <h1>Phase 0</h1>
    <h2>Week 1</h2>
    <h3>January 22nd, 2016</h3>
    <section>
      <p>This week I was introduced to version control, which is a way of tracking changes in coding or other projects. It basically creates a record of any and all changes made by participants, and includes detailed notes on when and why changes were made. This ensures that all versions of a project, from the earliest to the latest, are accessible at all times, which is a good thing in case you need to go back to earlier working versions in case of bugs, etc. It is also very important in large group projects, where people can work on the same material simultaneously and not delete each others’ work or otherwise confuse things. It is a good way to organize and view the progress being made and see who is responsible for which changes.</p>
      <p>Git is a software installed on the user’s local computer, and can be accessed from the command line interface. It is a simple and convenient way to commit changes made to a project, which is essentially creating a snapshot of the changes made with a few simple commands. It allows the user to label and create notes about the commit which keeps them organized. It also is easily integrated with GitHub or other repository sites to allow for collaboration.</p>
      <p>          GitHub is a remote online repository for code projects and is ideal for collaborating with a team. The main benefit is it creates a record of commits and changes, viewable from anywhere and anyplace which makes it more reliable. GitHub also is the place where pull requests and merges are made, and basically streamlines the collaborative process for team members with a clear system for making and recording changes. There are other online repositories but GitHub is the most popular site, so if you want to open your code to the general public it is the most accessible.      </p>

GPS 1.2 Reflection
In this challenge we used the HTML5 tags <nav> and <section>. I keep coming back to these tags and others such as <article> and <aside> because they are useful for defining content in a blog or webpage. <Nav> is useful for creating a section near the top for links to other pages on the same site, and <section> is good for creating portions of text content such as <p>s. These HTML5 tags are much more specific than just using <div> tags over and over again.
There is usually a certain order that elements are laid out on a page. First is the DOCTYPE and the <html> tags. Then comes the <head> containing the <title> which gives information about the page. After the <head> the <body> tags are used to contain a variety of tags such as <article>, <section>, and <aside> which house the main content the browser displays. At the end the <footer> gives information about the author and copyright. The browser displays the parent elements such as the <article> and then the child elements within, such as <h1> and <p>.
I learned a few things about Sublime in this challenge. I learned that by typing in html and the tab key, a simple html template is provided. I also learned about Sublime snippets, which are sections of code that can be used over and over. You can customize your own code snippet or use one that Sublime provides, such as a list. Snippets can be inserted into the code by using a tab trigger (a keyword followed by the tab key). I will definitely use snippets in the future, and look up some handy preexisting snippets, because it saves times and typing.
